# FikaSearch Exercise

The objective of this exercise is to fork this repository and create a `react-native` app called 'FikaSearch'. This app will comprise of a listing page of films and the names of their genres.

You have an hour to complete this. We don't expect you to complete the exercise but we do expect you to have an understandable structure, clean code, and to be able to describe your next steps.

## Technical details

### API
You will need to use the following URLs to fetch the films and genres from `the movie db` API:

movies - [https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/now_playing?api_key=d432b933ecc6d5642d8d2befbc40c7ac&language=en-US&page=1](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-now-playing)

genres - [https://api.themoviedb.org/3/genre/movie/list?api_key=d432b933ecc6d5642d8d2befbc40c7ac&language=en-US](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/genres/get-movie-list)

#### Images

The API will provide part of the image url via the `poster_path` field of each film. It must be combined with the base image path `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/`

**Have fun!**
